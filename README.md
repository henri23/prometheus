# Voltrum

A modern CAD application for microchip design built with **Vulkan**, **ImGui**, and **SDL3**. Designed with a clean core-client architecture for performance, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Features

- **Modern Vulkan Renderer** - High-performance graphics with validation layers and debugging support
- **Component-Based UI System** - Extensible ImGui interface with dockspace, custom titlebar, and font management
- **Memory Management** - Tagged allocation system with arena allocators for optimal performance
- **Cross-Platform** - Native support for Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC/Clang)
- **Asset Pipeline** - Efficient loading for images, fonts, and embedded resources
- **Developer Tools** - Modern build scripts, IDE integration, and comprehensive logging

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **C++17** compatible compiler (GCC 8+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2019+)
- **CMake** 3.16 or later
- **Vulkan SDK** 1.3+ with validation layers
- **Git** with submodule support

### Build

**Linux:**
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your-username/voltrum.git
cd voltrum
./build-ninja.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your-username/voltrum.git
cd voltrum
build.bat
```

## Architecture

### Core Engine (`voltrum_core.dll/so`)

The core engine provides fundamental systems and abstractions:

- **Application Framework** - Main loop, initialization, and event handling
- **Platform Layer** - SDL3-based windowing, input, and system integration
- **Vulkan Renderer** - Modern graphics API with command buffer management
- **UI System** - Component-based ImGui framework with dockspace and custom titlebar
- **Asset Management** - Efficient resource loading with caching
- **Memory System** - Tagged allocators and arena memory management

### Client Layer (`voltrum_client`)

The client layer implements application-specific functionality:

- **UI Components** - Custom windows, menus, and interface elements
- **Application Logic** - Game or application-specific code
- **Configuration** - Client-specific settings and initialization

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between engine and application code
- **Component Architecture** - Modular, extensible systems
- **Modern C++** - RAII, type safety, and performance-focused design
- **Cross-Platform** - Consistent behavior across Windows and Linux

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **[SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)** - Platform abstraction and window management
- **[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)** - Immediate mode GUI (docking branch)
- **[spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)** - Fast, header-only logging library
- **[stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)** - Image loading and manipulation
- **Vulkan SDK** - Modern graphics API

### Build Tools
- **CMake** - Cross-platform build system
- **Ninja** - Fast, small build system (recommended)

All dependencies are managed through git submodules or system packages.

## Development

### Build Scripts

The project includes sophisticated build scripts with modern UI:

- **`build-ninja.sh`** (Linux) - Fast ninja-based builds with colored output
- **`build-modern.sh`** (Linux) - Advanced build with progress tracking and logs
- **`build-ninja.bat`** (Windows) - Windows equivalent with Visual Studio integration

### IDE Integration

- **compile_commands.json** - Generated automatically for LSP/clangd support
- **CLion/Visual Studio** - Native CMake project support
- **VS Code** - C++ extension with IntelliSense support

### Code Quality

- **Static Assertions** - Compile-time type and size validation
- **Vulkan Validation** - Debug layer integration for graphics debugging
- **Memory Tracking** - Tagged allocation system for leak detection
- **Consistent Style** - `.clang-format` configuration included
